This is the embedded part of a project that aim to change inconvenient parts of using washing machine.

What are inconvenient parts of using washing machine?
### 1. Huge costs
Laundromat owner needs lots of moneys to buy machinesIn this case, we want to change the business model to renting machine. But renting machine has some concerns. For example, customer don't know the repaired history. To improve the confidence of laundromat owner renting machine, we combine this project with block chain.

### 2. Safty
Believe many people have experiences that loosing the clothes when they are using public washing machine. To solve the problem, we give every users password. The washing machine keep locks when anyone is using it. When the washing process is finished, user need to use the password to unlock it. So this can prevent the unsafety sutuation.

### 3. Inconvience
When we using the washing machine in dormitory, we usually meet the condition that all machines are working. We don't know the accurate left time, so we need to stay there to wait. It is very waste the time. To fix the inconvient, we create a function that users can make reservation by APP and check the left time without going there.
